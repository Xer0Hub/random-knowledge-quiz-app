WHAT I LEARNED IN FROM THIS PROJECT

1.
Sometimes using APIs and importing their data, the data may not be processed correctly and still
have HTML artifacts or other encode/decode pieces present. I had to import html to escape the
html encoding that was left in the questions I was pulling to the quiz.

A lesson can be learned here. If imported data displays artifacts, import or focus on what
type of data that is, why it's there, and how to decode or sanitize it.

2.
Tkinter generally always  requires the Canvas() method. The canvas allows you to stack things on it
and create the picture of the screen. In the past I've mistaken the Label() as the do-all. Canvas() also
requires the dimensions of placement before any other params. Example: Canvas(150, 125).

3.
Again a repeated lesson, but you must create a variable then place PhotoImage(file=) inside the var
to reference it as an image in the future.

4.
OOP - In the __init__ self. can seem ambiguous upon setup. If you write self. it just means you can access
it from anywhere in the code. I created some variables without 'self.' and that's because that's the only location I want to
use or reference is.
